Q1. 
I would expect it to print [1,2,2,3] because ,uniq does not mutate the caller.

Q2. 
! usually means either 'not', or that the method will mutate the caller. 
!= means not equal to. !username would be, if that is not the username
putting it at the end of a method implies a method that modifies the caller, like 
uniq!
!! turns any object into their boolean equivalent 
! turns any object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent 
? : is the ternary operator for if else
