# SMALL PROBLEMS - EASY 5 - CLEAN UP THE WORDS
=begin
  
PROBLEM: 
Given a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) and
an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, write a method that
returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters
replaced by spaces. If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur
in a row, you should only have one space in the result (the result
should never have consecutive spaces).
